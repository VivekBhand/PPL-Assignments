1.How is array declaration and initialization handled?
ANS.
The arrays declared in a single statement are split into multiple separate lines to declare individually and also are initiallized on the same line than at one in single statement.

2.Why does the statement a[i] = b[i] get broken down to two steps with
 an intermediate temporary?
ANS.
As similar case, we encountered with global variable, GIMPLE can't perform two operation i.e. read and assign array at once. Thus a temporary variable is used to solve the conflict.

3.Why are there CLOBBER statements at the end?
ANS. The CLOBBER statement are used to show that that the array has used up the memory allocated to it. It is out of scope.

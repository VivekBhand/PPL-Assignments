1.Identify the basic blocks that correspond  to the while loop. How is
 the GIMPLE for a while loop different from simple if-else jumps?
ANS.
The basic blocks(bb) 2, 3, 4 correspond to the while loop. The while loop is much similar to if-else jumps, as it also consists of conditional and unconditional gotos, but major diiference is ability to jump to previous bb, which seems not be present in if-else jump.

2.Identify the  basic blocks  for the nested  for-loop. You  should be
 able  to identify  intializers, conditions  and increments  for each
 loop as  well as  the shared  inner body.  Is there  really anything
 special about a for-loop as compared to a while-loop?



ANS.
BB 5 and BB 6 intializes the the outer loop, and inner loop respectively.
On BB 8 and BB 10, there are conditional checks for the inner and outer for loops.
The incremental BB are 7 and 9, where inner and outer loop variable are incremented respectively.

for- loop can be known as special type of while loops with variable intialization, and its periodic increment as basic blocks and then conditional jump to start of loop.

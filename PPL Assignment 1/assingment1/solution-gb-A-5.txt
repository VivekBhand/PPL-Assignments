1.Do you notice that each usage of local variable as an operand uses a
 suffix that can be tracked to it's assignment? Why do some variables
 have a suffix `(D)'?
ANS.
As the suffix is used to variable c_4 in the if condition. As the value of c is yet to be assigned at that point, suffix 'D' may have been used to denote it as uninitializes.

2.Find the point in the CFG in  which the paths of the two assignments
 to variable `a'  and `b' merge. You will notice that PHI statements
 have  been  introduced.  Can  you   guess  the syntax  of  the  PHI
 statements?
ANS.
PHI syntax is used in bb 5, where variable a_1 and b_2 are to be assigned values. The PHI syntax has two variable values from the two basic blocks which is shown in ()along variable name. PHI may be used to assign a value to variable based on from which bb has it's been jumped.
e.g. if for bb 3, there has been jump to bb 5, then out of  # a_1 = PHI <a_7(3), a_5(4)>, it will take a_7 as it was declared in bb 3 itself.


3.Can you think of an example in which a PHI node merges more than two
 versions of a variable?



ANS.
It can be a case in if-else if- else statements with more conditions, or with a preinitialized values of variables.
